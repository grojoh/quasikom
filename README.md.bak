The [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things "Internet of things on Wikipedia") refers to the vision of a global network of
physical objects (i.e. "things") equipped with computing and wireless
communication resources that enable them to be uniquely identified or even
exchange data with other connected devices. RFID tags and wireless sensor nodes
constitute the first wave of such non-traditional computing devices that will soon
populate the Internet ecosystem in vast quantities. An ever-increasing number
of everyday objects, ranging from kitchen appliances over items of clothing
and sports goods to cars and other vehicles, become equipped with
microprocessors and wireless transceivers, which enables them to communicate
with each other and access central resources over the Internet. In a recent
white paper, Cisco estimates the number of smart objects connected to the
Internet to exceed 50 billion in 2020. This evolution of the Internet
will change the way how we interact with the physical world surrounding us and
create exciting new opportunities for the economy in such areas as health care,
industrial automation, resource management, and transportation and logistics,
to name a few. 

The advent of [quantum computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing "Quantum computing on Wikipedia") is
another technological revolution that will soon have a profound impact on our daily life and may even disrupt whole industries.
In the not so distant future, quantum computers will be powerful enough to aid
the discovery of new drugs or materials, to organize the routes of millions of
self-driving cars in metropolitan areas without introducing traffic jams, or to
manage and improve the efficiency of national power grids. Unfortunately,
quantum computing has also a destructive side because a large-scale quantum 
computer would be able to break essentially every public-key cryptosystem in 
use today.
