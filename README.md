# QUASIKOM

The advent of [quantum computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing "Quantum computing on Wikipedia") is
a technological revolution that will soon have a profound impact on our daily life and may even disrupt whole industries.
In the not so distant future, large-scale quantum computers will be powerful enough to aid the discovery of new drugs or materials, to organize the routes of millions of self-driving cars in metropolitan areas without introducing traffic jams, or to manage and improve the efficiency of national power grids. Unfortunately, quantum computing has also a destructive side because a large-scale quantum computer with a few 1000 qubits would be able to break essentially every public-key cryptosystem in use today.
